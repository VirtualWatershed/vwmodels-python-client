# vwmodels-python-client

This repository will contain python client for the vwmodels api. It started
with a Swagger auto-generated client, shown here.


# Autogenerated client via swagger

In the [swagger branch of vwadaptor](https://github.com/VirtualWatershed/vwadaptor/tree/swagger) there is a [swagger specification](https://github.com/VirtualWatershed/vwadaptor/blob/swagger/swagger.yaml),
which I loaded in to [swagger-editor](http://editor.swagger.io/#/) then
generated the Python client by selecting "Generate Client > Python" in the
dropdown at the top.
